  Hey there! I'm Alex Pawlowski, and thanks for stopping by. Let me tell you a little about myself
</p>

Born and raised in Virginia Beach, I began a PhD program in Energy Science and Engineering at University of Tennessee Knoxville in June of 2014. Currently, I am conducting research in additive manufacturing of engine components to not only improve AM techniques, but find paths forward that AM could provide to transportation.

At the University of Virginia, I completed a Double Major in Mechanical Engineering and Material Science through the Engineering Science Program. While at UVa I competed with the Triathlon Team at the University of Virginia where I came to love the sport, competing in 12 races and 2 National Championships.

While I had a lot of involvements, each one helped to exercise my diverse passions and prepare me for a dream career in the automotive industry of which I hope to achieve following my completion of my PhD with the Bredesen Center.
