title: Welcome to my New Website

Hey there. Welcome to my new website! In the coming weeks I hope to fill this space with some of the things I am working on as I tackle the Quals after our first year in the Bredesen Center.

### What I hope to share

I'd like to use this space to show articles of interest, that I first started with Closed Loop last summer and move forward with applications in R that I have been slowly working on that could have some cool uses. A lot of good news sites already cover the good releases, I'd like to explore longer pieces with some implications of new tech and mobility, where my interests seem to most align.

Thanks for stopping by!

Alex
