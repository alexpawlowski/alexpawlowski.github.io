<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I encountered a truly strange bike last weekend. I was running on a local trail when I noticed what looked like a submarine on wheels making its way towards me. It was as if someone had taken a reclining bike, enclosed it in bright orange steel, and added an electric motor to it. The helmeted occupant of the mysterious contraption hummed past me, and raised an arm in casual greeting before peddling off into the sunset. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It turns out that I had encountered a <a href="http://www.velomobiles.co.uk/about/what-are-velomobiles/"><span class="s2">velomobile</span></a> - an enclosed, human-powered vehicle that offers greater speed and protection from the elements than traditional bicycles. As I expected, velomobiles are derived from recumbent bicycles, and can be purely human-powered or electric-assisted. Velomobiles aren’t stereotypical electric bikes, but my close encounter got me thinking about electric bicycles and their increasing presence in communities around the globe.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electric bikes first took hold in China as an efficient, inexpensive alternative to car ownership. China still leads the world in electric bike sales, <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/07/if-an-electric-bike-is-ever-going-to-hit-it-big-in-the-us-its-this-one/375167/"><span class="s2">with 32 million sold in 2013</span></a>, but other countries are slowly but surely expanding their own electric bike fleets. Although sales of traditional bikes have remained stagnant or fallen in many European countries in the past eight years, electric bike sales are slowly but surely <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/10/29/241586850/three-charts-and-a-few-words-on-the-rise-of-electric-bikes"><span class="s2">increasing</span></a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/business/e-bike-sales-are-surging-in-europe.html?_r=1"><span class="s2">250,000</span></a> electric bikes roam the roads in Switzerland, and electric bikes command around 11 percent of the market in Germany. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Faster than traditional bikes and considerably less expensive than automobiles, electric bikes are also gaining ground in the United States. Electric bicycle <a href="http://www.riide.com/"><span class="s2">startup companies </span></a>are popping up in major U.S. cities, and some <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/07/if-an-electric-bike-is-ever-going-to-hit-it-big-in-the-us-its-this-one/375167/"><span class="s2">experts</span></a> predict that the United States will take its place as a leader in electric bike sales in as few as twenty years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Contrary to stereotypes about clunky electric bikes common in previous decades, modern electric bikes are taking on all sorts of sleek, exciting forms. The winner of the 2014 Oregon Manifest <a href="http://oregonmanifest.com/the-project/"><span class="s2">Bike Design Project</span></a>, <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/high-tech-battery-powered-bicycle-might-just-make-sell-car/">Denny</a>, features an <span class="s2">onboard computer </span>that automatically shifts gears based on peddling intensity. My favorite innovation in electric cycling is the <span class="s2"><a href="https://www.superpedestrian.com/">Copenhagen Wheel</a>. The Copenhagen Wheel is</span> a high tech bike wheel that can replace any traditional bike wheel, and recaptures energy when braking or biking downhill. The Copenhagen Wheel’s flexible software development kit also provides software developers with the unique opportunity to develop new applications including navigation and wheel customization. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering the increasingly sophisticated models that are being developed, it comes as no surprise that more and more people are turning to electric bikes as a mode of transportation. As in most systems, our nation's transportation system benefits from increased diversity. We need a transportation system made up of cars, mass transit and human-powered vehicles alike. While cars will continue to serve as the dominant mode of transportation for the foreseeable future, this new generation of electric bikes will hopefully help to narrow the gap. </span></p>
