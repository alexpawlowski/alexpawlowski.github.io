title: Introducing Upcycl3d
---

Hey there. Welcome to Upcycl3d! Our project is simple. Inspired by an Instructables [post](www.instructables.com/id/eWaste-60-3DPrinter/?ALLSTEPS) last November, we set out to explore the concept of repurposing old electronic waste to print material also from waste based bioplstic - in this case, lignin. Over the next few weeks, we will be disecting old electronics and working through sorting their integration with new electronics.

### Project Setup

After look through the instructables post, we decided that we should expand the print area to build bigger (and probably more useful) structures. While we had obtained floppy disk drives and DVD drives already, we knew that we needed to find new motors to be able to handle the range of motion (and weight). We identified scanners  and 2d inkjet printers as likely candidates for stepper motors that are ideal for defined print motion (as well as tons of screws, bars, and metal). Over the next few days we will post about the disassembly process and things we found. 

### Parts List (Ordered)

* RAMPS 1.4
* Arduino Mega 2560
* 8" x 8" Heat Bed
* 5 x Servo Motor Driver
* Mk8 Drive Gear
* All Metal J-head hotend for 1.75 mm filament
* Optical Endstop Switch

### Parts List (Salvaged)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
